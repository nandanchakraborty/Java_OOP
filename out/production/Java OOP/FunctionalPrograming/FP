n functional programming paradigm, an application is written mostly using pure functions. Here pure function is a function
having no side effects. An example of side effect is modification of instance level variable while returning a value from
the function.

Following are the key aspects of functional programming.

Functions − A function is a block of statements that performs a specific task. Functions accept data, process it, and
return a result. Functions are written primarily to support the concept of re usability. Once a function is written, it
 can be called easily, without having to write the same code again and again.

Functional Programming revolves around first class functions, pure functions and high order functions.

A First Class Function is the one that uses first class entities like String, numbers which can be passed as arguments,
 can be returned or assigned to a variable.

A High Order Function is the one which can either take a function as an argument and/or can return a function.

A Pure Function is the one which has no side effect while its execution.

Functional Composition − In imperative programming, functions are used to organize an executable code and emphasis is
on organization of code. But in functional programming, emphasis is on how functions are organized and combined.
 Often data and functions are passed together as arguments and returned. This makes programming more capable and expressive.

Fluent Interfaces − Fluent interfaces helps in composing expressions which are easy to write and understand. These
 interfaces helps in chaining the method call when each method return type is again reused.


 List<Integer> list = List.of(1,2,3,4,5);
 list ==> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

 jshell> list.stream().filter(
    ...> element ->element%2 ==1)
 $2 ==> java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline$2@8bd1b6a

 jshell> list.stream().filter(
    ...> element ->element%2 ==1).
    ...> forEach(
    ...> element->System.out.println(element))
