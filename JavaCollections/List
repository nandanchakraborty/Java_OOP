//some list method practice using jshell


jshell> List<String> words = List.of("apple","bat","cat");
words ==> [apple, bat, cat]

jshell> words.size()
$2 ==> 3

jshell> words.isEmpty()
$3 ==> false

jshell> words.get(0)
$4 ==> "apple"

jshell> words.contains("cat")
$5 ==> true

jshell> words.indexOf("cat")
   ...>
$6 ==> 2

jshell> words.get(0)
$7 ==> "apple"

***Using the "of" word such as List.of is immutable that means u cant change anything from that.no addition
 but can delete
